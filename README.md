Functional enrichment analysis of high-throughput omics data

Overview of existing methods for enrichment analysis of gene expression data with
regard to functional gene sets, pathways, and networks. Functionality for 
differential expression analysis, set- and network-based enrichment analysis, 
along with visualization and exploration of results. Introduction to concepts 
for enrichment analysis of genomic regions and regulatory elements. Outlook on 
current developments to extend gene set enrichment analysis for data derived 
from multiple high-throughput omics assays.
